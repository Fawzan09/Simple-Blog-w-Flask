## Inspiration:
The inspiration for the website have been taken from the follwing:
* [Simple Personal Diary](https://github.com/harshit-saraswat/Personal-Blog-Diary-Website)- This is my project from Complete Web Development Bootcamp Course using HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and EJS. I though of making a Python/Flask based version of it with additional features.
I am following Corey Schafer's Flask Playlist on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) for this project.
